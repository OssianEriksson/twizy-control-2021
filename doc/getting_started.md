# Getting Started

# Directory Structure

* Documentation can be found in [doc](/doc)
* ROS-packages can be found in the [src](/workspace/src) sub-directory of the [catkin workspace](/workspace). This includes most of our production code but also packages used for testing, e.g. [2020's parallel parking](/workspace/src/twizy_parking_2020). 
* Radom, personal, poorly documented experiments for learning the tools we are using for this project can be found in [playground](/playground).
