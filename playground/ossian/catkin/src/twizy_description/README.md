# twizy_description

A simple model of a Twizy car

# Getting started

The model uses controllers packages which need to be installed:
```sh
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-ros-control ros-<distro>-ros-controllers
```
Replace '\<distro\>' (including the '\<\>') with the name of your [ROS distribution](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions) (e.g. melodic).
